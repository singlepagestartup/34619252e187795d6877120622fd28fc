# Introduction

Single Page Startup is a collection of practices and tools that enable development teams to efficiently create projects with both frontend and backend using the JavaScript programming language.

## Frontend

On the frontend, we follow good practices by using a set of tools that includes [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Redux-Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Cucmber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/). These tools allow for efficient development of projects of any size, from landing pages to large startups with user dashboards.

## Backend

We use Strapi as a core of backend. [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is a powerful open-source headless CMS that provides a robust and flexible API for developers to build web applications. It is customizable and can be used to build APIs for various types of applications with ease. Using Strapi saves time that would be spent writing the same code by hand. It provides a ready-made backend structure that can be easily modified and extended to fit the requirements of any project.

## Deployment

In addition to the main parts of the project, there is documentation in it on how to deploy the project in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment.

## Documentation

At Single Page Startup, we understand the importance of documentation in any project. That's why we have created a comprehensive documentation for using Single Page Startup, designed to be easily customizable to fit the specific requirements of your project. Our goal was to provide you with a boilerplate that includes documentation, allowing you to save time and focus on the actual development process. By using our documentation, you can supplement it as needed and confidently pass on your work to other development teams.
