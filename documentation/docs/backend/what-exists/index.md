# What exists in the project

The concept of inheritance is present not only at the level of Page-Blocks, but also at the level of repositories. Each repository at a higher level, such as `sps-lite`, `sps`, `sps-store`, inherits from the preceding one. Thus, the `sps` project has everything that `sps-lite` has, and `sps-store` has everything that `sps` has. It is planned to further develop versions and add new types of repositories with different functionality.
